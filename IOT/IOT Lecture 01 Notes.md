Internet of Things

Definition: The IoT is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles ("connected devices" or "smart devices"), buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity to collect and exchange data.

Building Blocks:

1. Identifiable (Recognizing Things)


2. Processing (Think and Decide)


3. Communicating (Talk to Other Devices)


4. Interacting (Take Action Based on Data)



Related Terminologies:

Machine-to-Machine (M2M)

Cyber Physical System (CPS)

Internet of Everything (IoE)
